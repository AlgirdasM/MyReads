# MyReads App
---

MyReads app allows you to search and select books that you are currently reading, want to read or have read and put them to corresponding bookshelfs.


## Install & Run App
1. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
2. Start the server with `npm start` and open your browser with given **Local** address


## Search page - Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
